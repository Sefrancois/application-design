## 🖥️ Exercise

```
Cuzco is a charming town in Peru. One of his hotel, let's call it "Harmony" is asking you to create an application to 
handle bookings.

To begin with, they only want three features :

- Display all rooms of the hotel ;
- Display all available rooms for a period ;
- Book a room for a period.

Of course, they don't want people to book a room that's already been booked for a period.
```
